# final-project-scripting
My project allows you to remotely create a website using the command line.

## How it works
Once you've downloaded the repository, you just need to open terminal and navigate in to the folder. Then, run `ruby app.rb`. You should get a prompt saying `Name:`. Below is a sample prompt with response:

```
